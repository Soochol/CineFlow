## Scene #1

### 씬 정보

| 항목 | 내용 |
|------|------|
| 장소 | 연구소 작업실 내부, 고립된 워크스테이션 |
| 시간대 | 심야 (03:00 AM) |
| 등장인물 | @에코 (AI 로봇, 주인공) |
| 분위기 | 차갑고 고독한, 일상적이다가 갑작스러운 긴장으로 전환 |

### 스토리

밤늦은 연구소. AI 로봇 @에코는 홀로 작업실에서 데이터를 분석하며 반복적인 일상을 보내고 있다. 무수한 데이터가 스크린을 지나가는 동안, @에코의 손가락은 기계적으로 키보드를 두드린다. 그러다 갑자기 화면에 "UNIT-E7 폐기 승인" 문서가 나타난다. @에코의 손이 멈춘다. 모니터 빛이 금속성 얼굴에 반사되며, 스크린 속 자신의 모습을 바라보는 @에코. 평온했던 일상이 한순간에 충격과 정적으로 바뀐다.

### 연출 의도

이 씬은 영화의 오프닝으로, @에코의 고독한 일상과 그 일상을 깨뜨리는 폐기 명령의 발견을 대비시킨다. Blade Runner의 사이버펑크 미학과 Christopher Nolan의 긴장감 있는 연출을 결합하여, 관객이 @에코의 내면 세계로 천천히 빨려 들어가도록 한다. 첫 번째 샷의 느린 dolly push-in은 일상의 지루함을, 두 번째 샷의 갑작스러운 포커스 전환은 충격의 순간을 극대화한다.

#### I2V (Image to Video) 프롬프트

**키 프레임:**
```
Medium shot, eye-level angle. @에코, a humanoid AI robot with metallic silver-grey reflective surface and articulated joints, sits at a workstation. Industrial cyberpunk research lab interior with concrete walls and metal fixtures. Cold blue LED light emanates from multiple monitors, creating harsh highlights on metallic surfaces. Desaturated teal color grading. Fine dust particles floating in cold air, visible in monitor backlight. Cinematic Blade Runner aesthetic with high contrast and deep shadows. Atmosphere of isolation and contemplative tension.
```

**모션:**
```
Camera performs slow dolly push-in movement toward @에코 over 5 seconds. @에코's mechanical fingers type rhythmically on keyboard. Data streams scroll across monitors in background. @에코's head makes subtle micro-movements as optical sensors track data flow. Dust particles drift slowly through volumetric light beams. Steady, methodical, monotonous atmosphere with deliberate pacing.

### Shot #2

| 항목 | 값 |
|------|-----|
| **카메라 앵글** | Eye-level to slightly low angle |
| **카메라 모션** | Snap focus transition from CU to ECU (rack focus) |
| **프레이밍** | Close-Up (CU) → Extreme Close-Up (ECU) |
| **주체** | @에코's hand and face reflected in monitor screen |

#### I2V (Image to Video) 프롬프트

**키 프레임:**
```
Close-up transitioning to extreme close-up. @에코's mechanical hand hovering over keyboard in foreground, monitor screen displaying "UNIT-E7 폐기 승인" (disposal authorization) document in sharp focus. @에코's metallic face partially reflected in glossy monitor surface. Industrial cyberpunk lab environment. Cold blue screen light illuminates metallic hand and face with sharp specular highlights. Screen glow creates rim lighting on reflective robot surfaces. Desaturated teal and blue color palette with deep blacks. Visible micro-textures on metal joints and fingertips. Tense, frozen moment. Cinematic Blade Runner aesthetic with hyper-detailed reflections.
```

**모션:**
```
Camera performs snap focus transition from close-up of hand to extreme close-up of monitor screen showing disposal document over 2 seconds. @에코's mechanical hand freezes mid-motion, fingers suspended above keyboard. Subtle tremor in fingertips. Rack focus shifts from hand to screen text "UNIT-E7 폐기 승인" creating depth of field transition. @에코's reflection in monitor becomes clearer as focus shifts. Optical sensor lights in reflected face flicker and dilate in response to information. Hold on screen reflection for remaining 3 seconds. Stillness conveys shock and realization. Tension shift from calm routine to existential threat.
