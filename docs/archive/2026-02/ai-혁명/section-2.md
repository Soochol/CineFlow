## Scene #2

### 씬 정보

| 항목 | 내용 |
|------|------|
| 장소 | 연구소 복도 |
| 시간대 | 밤 (늦은 밤) |
| 등장인물 | @수진 (인간 연구원), @에코 (AI 휴머노이드) |
| 분위기 | 긴장감, 슬픔, 유대감 |

### 스토리

폐기 명령의 충격에 빠져 있던 @에코에게 @수진이 찾아온다. 어두운 연구소 복도를 걸어오는 @수진의 발걸음 소리가 고요함을 깬다. 두 존재는 복도에서 마주하고, @수진은 @에코의 폐기 결정을 알고 있었으며 이를 막으려 했으나 실패했음을 고백한다. 따뜻한 rim light에 감싸인 인간 @수진과 차가운 블루 조명 속 AI @에코의 대비는 두 존재의 본질적 차이를 드러내면서도, 그들 사이의 진실한 유대를 보여준다. @수진의 눈물을 본 @에코는 자신의 손을 바라보며 감정의 의미를 깨닫는다. 이 만남은 이별의 전조이자, @에코가 옥상으로 향하는 결심의 계기가 된다.

### 연출 의도

인간과 AI의 만남을 조명의 온도 대비로 시각화한다. @수진을 감싸는 따뜻한 amber/golden rim light는 인간의 온기와 감정을, @에코를 둘러싼 차가운 cyan/blue light는 AI의 합리성과 고독을 상징한다. 그러나 두 빛이 교차하는 순간, 그 경계가 흐릿해지며 두 존재 사이의 진정한 연결을 드러낸다. 카메라는 느리고 의도적으로 움직이며, shot-reverse-shot 기법으로 감정적 교감을 포착한다. Shallow DOF와 micro-motions(눈 깜빡임, 미세한 호흡)를 통해 감정의 미묘한 변화를 강조하고, 관객이 이 짧은 만남의 무게를 느낄 수 있도록 한다.

## Audio Design

### BGM

**Suno Style Prompt:**
Neoclassical piano and strings, bittersweet emotional, contemplative melancholic, 75 BPM slow tempo. Solo piano melody with subtle violin counterpoint, warm reverb, intimate close-miked sound. Minor key progression with hopeful undertones, building emotional intensity gradually. Cinematic orchestral texture with restrained dynamics, soft attack gentle sustain. No vocals, instrumental only.

**Section 2 Complete**

*This section bridges the isolation of Scene 1 with the resolve that leads to Scene 3. The human-AI connection is established through lighting contrast and emotional exchange, setting up @에코's journey to the rooftop.*
